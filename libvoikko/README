General information
===================

This is libvoikko, library of free Finnish language tools using Malaga
natural language grammar development tool. The library is written in C++.

Libvoikko provides spell checking, hyphenation and grammar checking for
Finnish language. No other languages are supported at the moment, and there
are no serious plans to add such support. This is because internals of this
library may change significantly in future releases, and we think that
generally useful bits and ideas (if any) should rather be merged to existing
multi language tools such as Hunspell and LanguageTool. In fact, we hope to
make libvoikko obsolete, but currently there are no other libraries that
provide all the features we need. We feel that pushing new features to Hunspell
where they would need to be maintained essentially indefinitely should not be
done until we have gained enough experience to know which solutions work in the
real world.

This library is released under the GPL, version 2 or later. The author is
willing to license selected parts under other free licenses (such as LGPL or
MPL) if this will directly help the development of other free software
products.


Features
========

 - Spell checking using compound word and derivation rule system that is
   largely compatible with widely used proprietary Finnish spell checkers
   (Soikko, MS Word).
 - Spelling suggestions that are generated to catch most probable typing
   errors.
 - Special spelling suggestion mode that can be used to correct errors
   produced by optical character recognition software.
 - Hyphenator with compound hyphenation based on morphological analysis.
 - Various options to tune spell checking and hyphenation for different
   purposes and applications.
 - Grammar checking and context sensitive spell checking using paragraph
   based API.
 - String tokenizer and sentence splitter.
 - Morphological analyzer.

Documentation for using the library can be found from header file voikko.h.


Build requirements
==================

C++ compiler (GCC), Malaga developement headers and Python must be available
in order to build this library.


Runtime requirements
====================

The library needs libmalaga and a version of Suomi-malaga containing a file named
voikko-fi_FI.pro. The file must start with the following line:

info: Voikko-Dictionary-Format: 2

This should be considered a strict requirement for now. While some parts
of the library may work without Suomi-malaga, this mode of operation is
not tested and not guaranteed to behave consistently across minor releases
of the library.


Search order for dictionary files
=================================

A set of available dictionary variants is built by examining the contents of the
following directories. If a variant exists in more than one location, the first
occurrence is used and the rest are ignored.

1) Path given as the last argument to voikko_init_with_path, if that function is
   used to initialize the library.
2) Path specified by the environment variable VOIKKO_DICTIONARY_PATH, if the
   variable is set in the environment of the process initializing the library.
3) Only on platforms with Unix home directories (Linux, BSD and Mac OS X):
   a) from directory $HOME/.voikko
   b) from directory /etc/voikko
4) Only on Windows:
   a) Directory specified by the registry key
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Voikko\DictionaryPath.
   b) Directory specified by the registry key
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Voikko\DictionaryPath.
5) Path specified at compile time using --with-dictionary-path (this defaults to
   /usr/lib/voikko).

To all of the paths above additional path component "/2" is appended at the end.
This corresponds to the dictionary version and allows multiple versions of the same
dictionary to be installed simultaneously.

Variants are searched from subdirectories whose name start with "mor-". The
identifier and other dictionary metadata are read from a file "voikko-fi_FI.pro"
residing in that directory. If the file does not exist or is somehow considered
invalid, that particular variant is ignored.

One of the dictionaries is chosen to be the default dictionary by trying the
following rules:

1) If one of the subdirectories in the main directory paths described above has
   name "mor-default", the default dictionary will be the variant that is found
   from that directory. Note that this does not affect the actual decision about
   the dictionary instance used to provide the variant. If, for example, there is
   a directory $HOME/.voikko/2/mor-a containing variant "a" and a directory
   /etc/voikko/2/mor-default containing variant "a", the variant "a" will become the
   default but it will still be provided by $HOME/.voikko/2/mor-a.

2) If no default is specified, variant "standard" is used as the default.

3) If variant "standard" is not available, the variant with the name that comes
   first in alphabetical order is selected as the default.


Selection of the variant to use
===============================

The dictionary variant to be used is determined using the following rules, starting
from rule 1:

1) If the parameter 'langcode' given to functions voikko_init or voikko_init_with_path
   is NULL, no dictionary will be loaded. The behaviour of the library after such
   initialization is currently undefined.
2) If the parameter 'langcode' given to functions voikko_init or voikko_init_with_path
   is something else than "", "default" or "fi_FI", variant with that name is loaded.
   If the variant is not available, an error is returned.
3) If environment variable VOIKKO_DICTIONARY is defined, its value is used as the
   name of the dictionary variant to load. If the variant is not available, an error
   is returned.
4) Finally, the default variant is loaded. If no dictionary variants are available,
   an error is returned.
