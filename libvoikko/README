General information
===================

This is libvoikko, library of free natural language processing tools
The library is written in C++ and it uses a left associative grammar for
describing the morphology of Finnish language. The morphology is developed
using Malaga natural language grammar development tool.

Alternative backends that can be used instead of Malaga include HFST,
Lttoolbox and VFST. These backends are currently experimental.

Libvoikko provides spell checking, hyphenation, grammar checking and
morphological analysis for Finnish language. Support for other languages
is in experimental state. Libvoikko aims to provide support for
languages that are not well served by Hunspell or other existing free
linguistic tools. This can be done because we do not care about
compatibility with legacy dictionary formats and we support only actively
maintained languages. Pushing new features to Hunspell where
they would need to be maintained essentially indefinitely should not
be done until we have gained enough experience to know which solutions
work in the real world.


License
=======

This library is released under the GPL, version 2 or later. Parts of the
build system are available only under GPL version 3 or later but that
does not affect binary distribution.

Additionally a subset of the library is available under MPL 1.1 / GPL 2+ /
LGPL 2.1+ tri-license. The tri-license covers those parts that cannot
be configured away in the autotools build systems. Licensing status for
individual backends is as follows:

 Backend        License
----------------------------------------------------------------
 Malaga         GPL 2+
 HFST           GPL 3+ (GPL 2+ backend and Apache v2 dependency)
 Lttoolbox      GPL 2+ (GPL 2+ backend and GPL 2+ dependency)
 VFST           MPL 1.1 / GPL 2+ / LGPL 2.1+


Features
========

 - Spell checking using compound word and derivation rule system that is
   largely compatible with widely used proprietary Finnish spell checkers
   (Soikko, MS Word).
 - Spelling suggestions that are generated to catch most probable typing
   errors.
 - Special spelling suggestion mode that can be used to correct errors
   produced by optical character recognition software.
 - Hyphenator with compound hyphenation based on morphological analysis.
 - Various options to tune spell checking and hyphenation for different
   purposes and applications.
 - Grammar checking and context sensitive spell checking using paragraph
   based API.
 - String tokenizer and sentence splitter.
 - Morphological analyzer.
 - All functionality is made available through C, Python, Java and .Net APIs.

Documentation for using the library can be found from header file voikko.h.


Build requirements
==================

C++ compiler (GCC or clang) and Python (version 2.3 or later but not version 3)
must be available in order to build this library. Pkg-config is needed
for build configuration.

Java API is designed to be built as a Maven project. No autotools or Ant
based build system is available yet.


Build configuration
===================

See ./configure --help for a list of available configuration options.
The default configuration will enable all stable backends and will result
in a library that supports stable dictionary formats. This is the recommended
configuration for builds that are made available to end users.

You can enable certain experimental backends or disable stable backends. Such
configurations will not necessarily work with all dictionaries and the dictionary
formats may change without notice. Thus these options should generally be used
in developer builds only. If you need to use them in a released build we
strongly recommend that you disable external dictionary loading with
--disable-extdicts and supply compatible dictionaries along with the library.


Runtime requirements
====================

The library needs a version of Suomi-malaga containing a file named
voikko-fi_FI.pro. The file must start with the following line:

info: Voikko-Dictionary-Format: 2

This should be considered a strict requirement for now. While some parts
of the library may work without Suomi-malaga, this mode of operation is
not tested and not guaranteed to behave consistently across minor releases
of the library.

Python bindings work with Python version 2.5 or later. To use them with
Python 3 or later the module file (libvoikko.py) must first be converted
using the "2to3" utility from Python distribution.


Search order for dictionary files
=================================

A set of available dictionary variants is built by examining the contents of the
following directories. If a variant exists in more than one location, the first
occurrence is used and the rest are ignored.

1) Path given as the last argument to voikko_init_with_path, if that function is
   used to initialize the library.
2) Path specified by the environment variable VOIKKO_DICTIONARY_PATH, if the
   variable is set in the environment of the process initializing the library.
3) Only on platforms with Unix home directories (Linux, BSD and Mac OS X):
   a) from directory $HOME/.voikko
   b) from directory /etc/voikko
4) Only on Windows:
   a) Directory specified by the registry key
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Voikko\DictionaryPath.
   b) Directory specified by the registry key
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Voikko\DictionaryPath.
5) Path specified at compile time using --with-dictionary-path (this defaults to
   /usr/lib/voikko).

To all of the paths above additional path component "/2" is appended at the end.
This corresponds to the dictionary version and allows multiple versions of the same
dictionary to be installed simultaneously.

Variants are searched from subdirectories whose name start with "mor-". The
identifier and other dictionary metadata are read from a file "voikko-fi_FI.pro"
residing in that directory. If the file does not exist or is somehow considered
invalid, that particular variant is ignored.

One of the dictionaries is chosen to be the default dictionary by trying the
following rules:

1) If one of the subdirectories in the main directory paths described above has
   name "mor-default", the default dictionary will be the variant that is found
   from that directory. Note that this does not affect the actual decision about
   the dictionary instance used to provide the variant. If, for example, there is
   a directory $HOME/.voikko/2/mor-a containing variant "a" and a directory
   /etc/voikko/2/mor-default containing variant "a", the variant "a" will become the
   default but it will still be provided by $HOME/.voikko/2/mor-a.

2) If no default is specified, variant "standard" is used as the default.

3) If variant "standard" is not available, the variant with the name that comes
   first in alphabetical order is selected as the default.


Selection of the variant to use
===============================

The dictionary variant to be used is determined using the following rules, starting
from rule 1:

1) If the parameter 'langcode' given to functions voikko_init or voikko_init_with_path
   is NULL, no dictionary will be loaded. The behaviour of the library after such
   initialization is currently undefined.
2) If the parameter 'langcode' given to functions voikko_init or voikko_init_with_path
   is something else than "", "default" or "fi_FI", variant with that name is loaded.
   If the variant is not available, an error is returned.
3) If environment variable VOIKKO_DICTIONARY is defined, its value is used as the
   name of the dictionary variant to load. If the variant is not available, an error
   is returned.
4) Finally, the default variant is loaded. If no dictionary variants are available,
   an error is returned.
