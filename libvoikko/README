General information
===================

This is libvoikko, library of free natural language processing tools
The library is written in C++. The library supports multiple backends:

- VFST: Finite state transducer format used for Finnish morphology
  and as an experimental language independent backend.
- Malaga: Left associative grammar for describing the morphology of
  Finnish language.
- HFST: Supports ZHFST speller archives for various languages.
- Experimental Lttoolbox backend.

Libvoikko provides spell checking, hyphenation, grammar checking and
morphological analysis for Finnish language. Only spell checking is
supported for other languages through HFST backend.
Libvoikko aims to provide support for
languages that are not well served by Hunspell or other existing free
linguistic tools. This can be done because we do not care about
compatibility with legacy dictionary formats and we support only actively
maintained languages. Pushing new features to Hunspell where
they would need to be maintained essentially indefinitely should not
be done until we have gained enough experience to know which solutions
work in the real world.


License
=======

The core library and backends that are enabled by default are available
under MPL 1.1 / GPL 2+ / LGPL 2.1+ tri-license.

Malaga and Lttoolbox backends are available only under GPL version 2
or later.

Features
========

 - Spell checking using compound word and derivation rule system that is
   largely compatible with widely used proprietary Finnish spell checkers
   such as the one used in MS Word.
 - Spelling suggestions that are generated to catch most probable typing
   errors.
 - Special spelling suggestion mode that can be used to correct errors
   produced by optical character recognition software.
 - Hyphenator with compound hyphenation based on morphological analysis.
 - Various options to tune spell checking and hyphenation for different
   purposes and applications.
 - Grammar checking and context sensitive spell checking using paragraph
   based API.
 - String tokenizer and sentence splitter.
 - Morphological analyzer.
 - All functionality is made available through C, Python, Java and .Net APIs.

Documentation for using the library can be found from header file voikko.h.


Build requirements
==================

C++ compiler (GCC or clang) and Python (version 3.0 or later)
must be available in order to build this library. Pkg-config is needed
for build configuration.

Java API is designed to be built as a Maven project. No autotools or Ant
based build system is available yet.


Build configuration
===================

See ./configure --help for a list of available configuration options.
The default configuration enables those backends that are recommended for
typical use: VFST for Finnish and HFST for other languages.

Disabling the default backends is safe if you do not need to use the dictionary
formats supported by them.

You can also enable certain experimental backends. Such configurations will
not necessarily work with all dictionaries and the dictionary
formats may change without notice. Thus these options should generally be used
in developer builds only. If you need to use them in a released build we
strongly recommend that you disable external dictionary loading with
--disable-extdicts and supply compatible dictionaries along with the library.


Runtime requirements
====================

For dictionary format 2 (Malaga and experimental backends):

 The library needs a version of Suomi-malaga containing a file named
 voikko-fi_FI.pro. The file must start with the following line:

 info: Voikko-Dictionary-Format: 2

For dictionary format 3 (HFST backend):

 Any valid ZHFST speller with file suffix .zhfst can be used. The name
 of the file is not significant.
 
For dictionary format 5 (Finnish VFST backend):

 Valid VFST dictionaries can be built from voikko-fi version 2.0 or later.

Python bindings work with Python version 2.7 or later. No conversion is needed
in order to use the module with Python 3.


Search order for dictionary files
=================================

A set of available dictionary variants is built by examining the contents of the
following directories. If a variant exists in more than one location, the first
occurrence is used and the rest are ignored.

1) Path given as the last argument to voikkoInit.
2) Path specified by the environment variable VOIKKO_DICTIONARY_PATH, if the
   variable is set in the environment of the process initializing the library.
3) Only on platforms with Unix home directories (Linux, BSD and Mac OS X):
   a) from directory $HOME/.voikko
      i) Only on Mac OS X: from directory $HOME/Library/Spelling/voikko
   b) from directory /etc/voikko
4) Only on Windows:
   a) Directory specified by the registry key
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Voikko\DictionaryPath.
   b) Directory specified by the registry key
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Voikko\DictionaryPath.
5) Path specified at compile time using  --with-dictionary-path

In 2), 4) and 5) it is possible to specify multiple locations by separating them with
the OS specific paths separator (; on Windows, : on other operating systems).
The locations will be processed in the listed order.

Locations 2) to 5) are not used if the library is configured with --disable-external-dicts
Using this option is recommended if dictionaries are distributed with the library
and support for experimental dictionary formats is enabled.

To all of the paths above additional path component "/2" is appended at the end.
This corresponds to the dictionary version and allows multiple versions of the same
dictionary to be installed simultaneously. The version number may be other than "2".

Dictionaries and language variants are searched from files or subdirectories using
the rules that are specific to each format version.

One of the dictionaries is chosen to be the default dictionary by trying the
following rules:

1) If one of the subdirectories in the main directory paths described above has
   name "mor-default", the default dictionary will be the variant that is found
   from that directory. Note that this does not affect the actual decision about
   the dictionary instance used to provide the variant. If, for example, there is
   a directory $HOME/.voikko/2/mor-a containing variant "a" and a directory
   /etc/voikko/2/mor-default containing variant "a", the variant "a" will become the
   default but it will still be provided by $HOME/.voikko/2/mor-a.

2) If no default is specified, variant "standard" is used as the default.

3) If variant "standard" is not available, the variant with the name that comes
   first in alphabetical order is selected as the default.


Selection of the variant to use
===============================

The dictionary variant to be used is determined using the following rules, starting
from rule 1:

1) If the parameter 'langcode' given to functions voikko_init or voikko_init_with_path
   is NULL, no dictionary will be loaded. The behaviour of the library after such
   initialization is currently undefined.
2) If the parameter 'langcode' given to functions voikko_init or voikko_init_with_path
   is something else than "", "default" or "fi_FI", variant with that name is loaded.
   If the variant is not available, an error is returned.
3) If environment variable VOIKKO_DICTIONARY is defined, its value is used as the
   name of the dictionary variant to load. If the variant is not available, an error
   is returned.
4) Finally, the default variant is loaded. If no dictionary variants are available,
   an error is returned.
